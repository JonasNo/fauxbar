When you install Fauxbar for the first time, Fauxbar processes your Chrome history items and bookmarks to create its own separate index. This only takes a moment, and once complete, the index is updated silently on-the-fly from then on.

When visiting a site that has a search box, Fauxbar displays a "Fauxbar+" icon in Chrome's Omnibox, signaling that it can add the page's search engine to Fauxbar's Search Box.

In this example, Fauxbar has detected Wolfram|Alpha has a search engine it can use. By clicking the Fauxbar+ icon, you can add the search engine to Fauxbar.

A Chromified version of Fauxbar's Address Box can be accessed from Chrome's Omnibox.

By pressing F and then Spacebar, you can find your history items and bookmarks using Fauxbar from the Omnibox. This can be handy if you don't feel like opening the main Fauxbar page.
