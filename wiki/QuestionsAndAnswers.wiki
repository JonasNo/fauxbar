= Fauxbar Questions & Answers =

=== 1. Why was this extension created? ===
Fed up with Firefox's poor memory performance and Chrome's unpredictable Omnibox behavior, Fauxbar was created to combine Firefox's Awesome Bar functionality with Chrome's stability.

=== 2. What version of Chrome is required? ===
Fauxbar requires Google Chrome version 13 or higher to run, and works on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

=== 3. Should I always leave Fauxbar enabled? ===
For best results, yes, always leave it enabled if you can. If Fauxbar is disabled and you continue browsing with Chrome, Fauxbar's index will become out of sync with Chrome's index. While you can get Fauxbar back up to speed by clicking the Reindex button within Fauxbar's options, this can be tedious.

=== 4. Can I open Fauxbar without opening a New Tab? ===
Yes. Use this address:

`chrome-extension://hibkhcnpkakjniplpfblaoikiggkopka/fauxbar.html`

You could add this to your bookmarks bar, or set it as Chrome's home page.

=== 5. Why the name "Fauxbar"? ===
Since it's impossible to add or modify a bar to Chrome's UI, Fauxbar's "bar" is merely part of the extension's HTML page. So really it's a fake bar, or a faux bar.

=== 6. What is the Fauxbar logo supposed to be? ===
It's a red panda. A faux fox, if you will.
