Solutions to problems that Fauxbar may encounter.

----

== Chrome will not stay open ==

=== Cause ===

There is a bug in Fauxbar v1.3.0 and v1.3.1 that can cause Chrome to close itself after you launch it.

=== Solution ===

Fauxbar needs to be upgraded to v1.3.2. Here's how you can do this:

 # Create a blank HTML file on your desktop. (you can create a blank .txt file and rename it to .html)
 # Double-click the HTML file to open the file with Chrome; Chrome will remain open. If Chrome is not your default browser, right-click the HTML file and choose to open the file with Chrome.
 # Open Chrome's Extensions page ( chrome://extensions ).
 # Enable "Developer mode" at the top of the page.
 # Click the "Update extensions now" button.
 # After a moment, Fauxbar should restart itself and be updated to v1.3.2.

If Fauxbar does not seem to want to update to v1.3.2, here's how to temporarily resolve this bug:

 # Open Fauxbar's Options.
 # Under the General > Tab Override category, select Method 1 as the override method. (Method 2 is causing the bug)
 # Close and restart Chrome.

For further details and discussion, please view issue #138.

== Trouble displaying site thumbnails ==

=== Symptoms ===

 * Fauxbar displays a message saying:
  * "Fauxbar is having trouble displaying site thumbnails", or
  * "Fauxbar has encountered a security error. Unable to access thumbnail files.".

 * Fauxbar's site tiles no longer show their thumbnail images, even though they used to.

=== Cause ===

Fauxbar is attempting to use Chrome's HTML5 !FileSystem, which Fauxbar stores site thumbnails in, but Chrome is throwing a "!FileError.SECURITY_ERR" error.

This is a problem that can occur with Chrome, and is out of Fauxbar's control.

=== Solution ===

To resolve this problem:

 # Navigate to "*C:\Users\_USERNAME_\!AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\File System\Origins*".
 # Delete the file named "*CURRENT*".
 # Exit Chrome.
 # Open Chrome.

If deleting the CURRENT file above does not work, uninstalling and re-installing Chrome should fix this problem.
