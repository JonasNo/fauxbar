Solutions to problems that Fauxbar may encounter.

----

== Trouble displaying site thumbnails ==

=== Symptoms ===

 * Fauxbar displays a message saying:
  * "Fauxbar is having trouble displaying site thumbnails", or
  * "Fauxbar has encountered a security error. Unable to access thumbnail files.".

 * Fauxbar's site tiles no longer show their thumbnail images, even though they used to.

=== Cause ===

Fauxbar is attempting to use Chrome's HTML5 !FileSystem, which Fauxbar stores site thumbnails in, but Chrome is throwing a "!FileError.SECURITY_ERR" error.

This is a problem that can occur with Chrome, and is out of Fauxbar's control.

=== Solution ===

To resolve this problem:

 # Exit Chrome.
 # Navigate to "*C:\Users\_USERNAME_\!AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\File System\Origins*".
 # Delete the file named "*CURRENT*".
 # Open Chrome.

If deleting the CURRENT file above does not work, uninstalling and re-installing Chrome should fix this problem.
