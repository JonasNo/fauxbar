= Fauxbar Version History =

*1 August 2011 - v0.2.1*:
 * Fauxbar tabs now load faster than before. (added CSS caching and optimized tile memory usage)
 * Fauxbar's version number is now shown under Fauxbar Options > Management.

*30 July 2011 - v0.2.0*:
 * New and improved:
   * Added an error logging system, so users can submit reports to help improve and cheer up Fauxbar. Available in Fauxbar's Options > Management.
   * Error messages are now less intrusive and more informative. The option to display error messages has been automatically re-enabled for this release.
   * Added an option to "consolidate duplicate bookmarks", so that duplicate bookmarks don't clutter Address Box results. Enabled by default. Toggleable in Fauxbar's Options > Address Bar.

*27 July 2011 - v0.1.1:*
 * New and improved:
   * Fauxbar now lets you know when an update has been applied.
   * Fauxbar loading times have been improved, if input box icon colors and bookmark icon opacity levels are using their default values.
   * Added default tooltips for colors and opacity levels in the options.
 * Fixed issues:
   * Bookmark frecency scores were being incorrectly calculated after deleting a bookmark folder from Chrome.
   * The clickable http://fauxbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Fauxbar/fauxbar16options.png icon would always display a link to edit site tiles, even if you'd opted not to show them.
   * [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/domhiadbdhomljcdankobiglghedagkm Fauxbar Memory Helper] would (try to) restart Fauxbar while the site tile editor was open.
   * Custom input box icon colors were not being applied when being hovered over.
 * Changed:
   * The Address Box will no longer display bookmark URLs that begin with "javascript:void", as these seem to crash Fauxbar.

*26 July 2011 - v0.1.0:*
 * Added the ability to manually select and arrange site tiles. Available in Fauxbar's Options > Tiles > Site Tiles.
 * Decreased the default Typed frecency transition bonus score from 125 to 100, so that Omnibox page transitions no longer inflate scoring. This brings all default transition type bonus scores to 100, except for !Auto_Bookmark, which remains at 75.
 * Fixed a bug where clearing Chrome's recent browsing history would remove partially affected history items completely from Fauxbar's index, instead of just recalculating their frecency scores.
 * Decreased the default amount of previous queries the Search Box can display from 20 to 10.

*23 July 2011 - v0.0.7:*
 * Site tile loading times have been improved.
 * All database queries have been optimized for better performance.
 * The Options page will now try to open into an existing Fauxbar tab if possible.
 * Tiles now have their own main section in the Options page.

*21 July 2011 - v0.0.6:*
 * Improved handling of links for fi**le:/// URLs.
 * Added options to prevent fi**le:/// URLs, pinned URLs and opened URLs from being displayed as top site tiles. Available under Fauxbar Options > General > Tiles.
 * Top site frecency scores will now be recalculated more often.

*20 July 2011 - v0.0.5:*
 * Clicking a "Switch to tab" result will no longer sometimes cause the current tab to doubly open the clicked URL.
 * Disabled caching of site tile thumbnails; they should update more promptly now.
 * Added an option to always show the Options "..." icon in the Omnibox. Available under Fauxbar Options > General > Omnibox. Disabled by default.
 * Improved the way speech input is handled.

*19 July 2011 - v0.0.4:*
