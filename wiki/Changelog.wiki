= Fauxbar Version History =

*30 August 2011 - v1.0.1:*
 * Fixed:
  * Fauxbar was causing certain redirection pages to stall. (issue #46)
  * URLs with unencoded spaces were not being recognized as valid URLs. (issue #48)

----

*23 August 2011 - v1.0.0:*

 * Fauxbar has come out of beta and is now available to the public. Thank you to all who helped beta test Fauxbar to get to this point!

----

*22 August 2011 - v0.5.4:*

_This version is a release candidate for Fauxbar 1.0.0._
 * New:
  * You can now choose a background image from your computer. Available in Fauxbar's Options > Page Background.
  * You can now manually add search engines to Fauxbar, if you know the search URL you want to enter. Available in Fauxbar's Options > Search Engines.
 * Improved:
  * Pre-rendering for Address Box result pages is now more intelligent. If enabled, Fauxbar will record what you type and which results you go to. Then, if you type the same query again in the future, Fauxbar will assume you want to go to the same page as last time, and will ask Chrome to start pre-rendering the page in the background for you. Toggleable in Fauxbar's Options > Address Box > Results. (the previous time-delay option has been removed)
  * Thumbnail filesizes have been decreased without affecting quality, so future tiles should load slightly faster.
  * Added a message during bookmark reindexing, advising that Address Box results may be delayed during this process. (happens when a bookmark folder is deleted)
  * Set the default font to "Ubuntu" for Linux installations.
  * Added a slight delay before fetching Address Box results when queries are one-character-long, to help prevent Address Box lag.
 * Changed:
  * In preparation for Fauxbar's 1.0.0 public release, error alerts and error counts are disabled by default (for new installs).
 * Fixed:
  * Input box sizes and icon positions were displaying unevenly if the font size was less than 15 pixels; this was most noticeable on Mac OS. (*note:* this change will be fully applied when you open Fauxbar's options)
  * The "Edit Tiles" button within Fauxbar's Options was not working properly.
  * Clicking a search suggestion from the Address Box would sometimes enter the text in the Search Box instead.
  * When selecting a Search Box search engine, the search engine selection would not persist between tab sessions.
  * Custom input box font colors were not being applied to placeholder texts.
  * Search suggestions were not getting truncated with "..." if they were too long.
  * Unhelpful/undebuggable errors were getting added to the error log. (unhelpful errors tend to get reported if XMLHttpRequest logging is not enabled in Chrome's dev console)
  * The color picker palette was not displaying consistently. (updated jscolor from v1.3.1 to v1.3.9)

----

*17 August 2011 - v0.5.3:*
 * Enhanced:
  * Fauxbar now opens faster than before, meaning Omnibox focus can be stolen more quickly. (reordered and delayed loading of certain functions)
  * Fauxbar now uses less memory. (implemented a new site thumbnail storage method)
 * Fixed:
  * Speech input wasn't triggering results to be displayed.
 * Known issues:
  * Site thumbnail images have been reset for this release, as Fauxbar now stores them using the !FileSystem API instead of SQLite.
  * Site tiles still don't load very fast, but this is no different than before.

----

*15 August 2011 - v0.5.2:*
 * New:
  * You can now change the number of maximum site tiles per row while in tile edit mode.
  * Added an option to prompt for confirmation before deleting a history result when using Quick Delete. Enabled by default. Toggleable in Fauxbar's Options > Results & Suggestions > Quick Delete.
  * Added a "Delete from History" context menu option for Address Box results.
  * "Switch to tab" functionality is now optional. Enabled by default. Changeable under Fauxbar's Options > Address Box > Results.
 * Fixed:
  * Site tiles sometimes had a large gap between the thumbnail and tile name.
  * Omnibox result titles would sometimes display "undefined" if they did not have a keyword.
  * History items removed via Quick Delete were not getting deleted from Fauxbar properly if a bookmark for the URL existed; said bookmarks' frecency scores were then not getting updated with the unvisited bookmark frecency score.
  * Address Box results were not displaying properly if result titles contained quotation marks.
  * Page titles were sometimes getting applied to the wrong history URL in Fauxbar's database during page transitions.
  * Tile thumbnails were not getting created if the tile's target page did not have !JavaScript enabled.

----

*13 August 2011 - v0.5.1:*
 * Fixed:
  * The General > Startup option for "When Fauxbar opens, focus: Chrome's Omnibox" was not working correctly.

----

*13 August 2011 - v0.5.0:*
 * New:
  * Fauxbar can now cut, copy and paste text. To continue using Fauxbar, you must accept this new clipboard-access permission when Chrome asks you.
  * Right-clicking on anything within Fauxbar will now display a custom context menu. Menu options that appear may include:
    * Customize Fauxbar
    * Edit Tiles
    * Paste & Go
    * Quick access to Fauxbar's search engines
    * Add/Edit Bookmark
    * Add Keyword
    * <i>Note:</i> If needed, you can access Chrome's normal context menu by Ctrl+Right-clicking.
  * Keywords can now be assigned to Address Box results. Right-click on a result to add or edit a keyword for the result's URL. Then, when you start typing that keyword into the Address Box, the keyworded result will appear above all other results. Keywords are a Fauxbar-only feature, and are kept separate from Chrome's database, and are not synced between installations. However, keywords can be backed-up and restored via Fauxbar's Options > Management > Backup/Restore.
  * The Address Box's globe icon is now clickable, giving access to Fauxbar's search engines, much like the Search Box. If the Search Box seems somewhat obsolete now, you can opt to show only the Address Box via Fauxbar's Options > General > Input Boxes.
 * Enhanced:
  * Modified the way search engine names look when using search engines in the Address Box.
  * Fauxbar's Options page width is now independent from the Fauxbar's width, meaning it won't get squished too thinly anymore.
  * Fauxbar now performs a quick bit of database maintenance upon each start-up, to optimize its database's speed.
 * Fixed:
  * When adding a search engine, URL parameters were sometimes not getting processed properly.
  * Bookmark star icons were sometimes causing Address Box results to become too tall.
  * Search engine keywords were not getting applied when restoring Fauxbar's options.
  * Bookmark and history item frecency scores were becoming out of sync in some cases.
  * Newly-installed Chrome apps were not appearing in Fauxbar right away.
 * Hopefully fixed:
  * Added further delays to Fauxbar Memory Helper's communication with Fauxbar. It seems that if Fauxbar is using a lot of memory, and is then disabled and re-enabled too fast, it crashes when it tries to start. Memory Helper has been updated to version 0.0.3.
 * Known issues:
  * Mac OS styling is sub-par to the Windows version.

----

*5 August 2011 - v0.4.1:*
 * Fixed:
  * Search suggestions and queries were not being displayed when using search engine keywords with just the Address Box showing.

----

*5 August 2011 - v0.4.0:*
 * New:
  * Search engine keywords have been added, letting you access your Fauxbar search engines from the Address Box and/or Search Box by typing an engine's keyword and pressing spacebar. Keywords can be defined in Fauxbar's Options > Search Box > Search Engines. Suggestions and past queries can be toggled in Fauxbar's Options > Address Box > Keywords.
 * Changed:
  * The default unvisited bookmark bonus frecency score has been been reduced from 140 to 1, as unvisited bookmarks seemed to often appear higher than history items that you're trying to revisit. If you were using the default score of 140, you can apply the new scoring change, if desired, by reindexing Fauxbar in Fauxbar's Options > Management > Database. Afterwards, if you happen to have difficulty finding an unvisited bookmark, try adding the *is:fav* modifier to your search string.
  * A more efficient method of preventing data: URLs from being displayed in Address Box results has been implemented, but you may need to reindex Fauxbar for this change to take effect. (if Address Box results still seem fast enough for you, don't worry about this)
 * Fixed:
  * When history items are removed from Chrome, they should now also be removed from Fauxbar.
  * Blacklisted URLs will no longer appear in Fauxbar's Omnibox results.
  * Errors occurring during page transitions should now be logged properly.
  * Search engines sending invalid JSON suggestions will no longer throw errors.
  * Links in the "latest tweet" part of the Support section will now work properly.
 * Hopefully fixed:
  * To try and resolve Fauxbar's occasional start-up crashes, the loading order of certain !JavaScript files has been changed, and small communication delays between Fauxbar and Fauxbar Memory Helper have been added. (Memory Helper has been updated to v0.0.2)
 * Known issues:
  * When showing just the Address Box without the Search Box, search suggestions are not being displayed when using search engine keywords.

----

*3 August 2011 - v0.3.0:*
 * New:
  * Fauxbar now requires Google Chrome v13 to run. You can update Chrome by clicking Chrome's Wrench > About Google Chrome.
  * When using the Address Box, the first result displayed can now be pre-rendered for you. Enabled by default. Toggleable in Fauxbar's Options > Address Box > Results.
  * Unwanted domains and URLs can now be excluded from showing up in Address Box results. Manage your blacklist in Fauxbar's Options > Address Box > Results.
 * Improved:
  * Optimized the way Alt+D, Ctrl+K and Ctrl+L shortcuts are handled. (dropped the jQuery Hotkeys plugin and fixed some Chrome 13 hanging issues)
 * Fixed:
  * Typing too fast into the Address Box would sometimes display non-matching results.
  * Input box icons were getting recolored even if the default color was selected. Fauxbar should load more quickly now.
  * Pressing Ctrl+Enter in the Address Box will now only wrap "www." and ".com" around your actual typed input, ignoring any auto-filled text.
  * Opening the Error Log will now clear the red error count if the Error Log turns out to be empty.

----

*2 August 2011 - v0.2.3:*
 * Added:
  * A new Support section is now available in Fauxbar's Options, containing links to Fauxbar's documentation and social engagement pages.

----

*1 August 2011 - v0.2.2:*
 * Fixed:
  * Site tile thumbnails should now persist between sessions again. (fixes bug from v0.2.1)

----

*1 August 2011 - v0.2.1:*
 * New and improved:
  * Fauxbar tabs now load faster than before. (added CSS caching and optimized tile memory usage)
  * Fauxbar's version number is now shown under Fauxbar Options > Management.
 * Known issues:
  * Thumbnails for manually-selected site tiles are not getting saved between sessions. To fix, enter Tile Editing Mode and click Save (should only have to do this once).

----

*30 July 2011 - v0.2.0:*
 * New and improved:
   * Added an error logging system, so users can submit reports to help improve and cheer up Fauxbar. Available in Fauxbar's Options > Management.
   * Error messages are now less intrusive and more informative. The option to display error messages has been automatically re-enabled for this release.
   * Added an option to "consolidate duplicate bookmarks", so that duplicate bookmarks don't clutter Address Box results. Enabled by default. Toggleable in Fauxbar's Options > Address Bar.

----

*27 July 2011 - v0.1.1:*
 * New and improved:
   * Fauxbar now lets you know when an update has been applied.
   * Fauxbar loading times have been improved, if input box icon colors and bookmark icon opacity levels are using their default values.
   * Added default tooltips for colors and opacity levels in the options.
 * Fixed issues:
   * Bookmark frecency scores were being incorrectly calculated after deleting a bookmark folder from Chrome.
   * The clickable http://fauxbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Fauxbar/fauxbar16options.png icon would always display a link to edit site tiles, even if you'd opted not to show them.
   * [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/domhiadbdhomljcdankobiglghedagkm Fauxbar Memory Helper] would (try to) restart Fauxbar while the site tile editor was open.
   * Custom input box icon colors were not being applied when being hovered over.
 * Changed:
   * The Address Box will no longer display bookmark URLs that begin with "javascript:void", as these seem to crash Fauxbar.

----

*26 July 2011 - v0.1.0:*
 * Added the ability to manually select and arrange site tiles. Available in Fauxbar's Options > Tiles > Site Tiles.
 * Decreased the default Typed frecency transition bonus score from 125 to 100, so that Omnibox page transitions no longer inflate scoring. This brings all default transition type bonus scores to 100, except for !Auto_Bookmark, which remains at 75.
 * Fixed a bug where clearing Chrome's recent browsing history would remove partially affected history items completely from Fauxbar's index, instead of just recalculating their frecency scores.
 * Decreased the default amount of previous queries the Search Box can display from 20 to 10.

----

*23 July 2011 - v0.0.7:*
 * Site tile loading times have been improved.
